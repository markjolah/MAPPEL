    Python bindings for the MAPPEL [Maximum A-Posteriori Point Emitter Localization] library.  MAPPEL is an open source, fast point emitter localization
    algorithm for analysis of diffraction limited point emitters in super-resolution fluorescence microscopy images.  MAPPEL includes state of the art
    optimization algorithms for Maximum likelihood, maximum a-Posteriori point emitter optimization, as well as Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior density
    estimates, and profile likelihood based inference.  Computations are performed in parallel using high-performance OpenMP C++ extension modules.
